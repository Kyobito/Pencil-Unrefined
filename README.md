# Pencils
Pencils Bot Documentation v3.0:

## Warning
This bot should not be released outside of a particular server. Due to the lack of databasing and cross-server settings exchanging, the code here should only be used for bots that monitor 1 server.
## About 
Pencils is a multipurpose bot meant to provide servers (specifically IEatPencils) with:
 - Music (Check future changes)
 - Administrative actions (Check future changes)
 - Custom Text editing
 - News and Youtube support
 - and more.

## Future changes 
 - Add more custom text changes
 - ?Merge queue into play | Allow play to run audio on first command and queue up songs
 - ?Change view to new name "queue"
 - ?Allow for playlist support
 - ?Allow for spotify support
 - Add image modifications

## Note
Though the future of the bot is uncertain, the bot will likely stay privately on the IEatPencils server but will remain open source.

## Author's words
The database system on Repl.it isn't the largest so making the bot private seems to be the best option.
